            End of April in 2019 I had to relocate to England. It was a one-month business trip to work on a project for
            American Express. I was working in their office in Burgess Hill, a small town located in Mid Sussex.
            However, I was residing in Haywards Heath, another rustic town situated four miles from Burgess Hill. A
            first good impression upon arrival, the green woodlands and groves on our way from Gatwick airport to our
            destination. Every day I would commute using different means of transportation to experience their services
            as well as perceive different routes and areas. Mid Sussex, which is part of West Sussex, consists of small
            towns and villages separated by vast rural areas.
        </p>

            <p class="caption">Haywards Heath</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            On any journey, you will see uninhabited and agricultural areas. The office where I was working daily, is
            situated in the centre of Burgess Hill with a great panoramic view over the town. Being the tallest building
            in the area, one could see far over the hills. However, as you can imagine, in such isolated areas, there
            are limited sources of entertainment. Therefore hours after work were difficult to spend. Besides visiting
            local restaurants and pubs, a nice way to kill some time was to simply stroll through the village, visit
            nearby parks and forests and discover England’s suburban life.

            In my favour, Haywards Heath is located between London and Brighton, two magnificent cities. Each of them
            special in their way. First, I visited London. It was my first time in the city. On a Friday evening after
            work, I took the train there. London is seriously immense! Arriving at Victoria central station and simply
            stepping out on the street already gives you an overwhelming feeling. From Victoria to Buckingham palace it
            is a 10-minute walk. The city centre was in the opposite direction of my place. However, I wanted to get a
            glimpse of this amazing city right away. The next morning my sister would join me from Aberdeen. We stayed
            in a cosy place in Chelsea, right between King’s Road and river Thames.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chelsea is one of the most desirable areas of London and shone brightly during the 60s Swinging London
            period. Whenever I visit a new place, I want to spend half of the days as a tourist and half of them as a
            local. As a tourist, I want to visit all the famous museums and well-known attractions. While, “local” me,
            wants to enjoy the beauty of it without any rush or concerns. Simply enjoying the small things in a day. As
            it was a weekend trip though I wanted to see as much as possible in those two days. So on Saturday, we
            started our exploration towards the centre walking alongside the Thames.
        </p>
        <div class="polaroid">

            <p class="caption">Thames and palace of Westminster</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            From there we reached the Westminster area where one can see Big Ben, Palace of Westminster and Westminster
            Abbey. Unfortunately, Big Ben was under restoration during that period so we couldn’t have a clear view of
            it.

            Another “must” London experience is to ride the famous Tube. It is the first underground railway system in
            the world. It operates since 1863 and consists of 11 lines, 270 stations and spans 402km. Besides saving a
            tremendous amount of time on each movement, it is fun figuring out the lines, connections and the direction
            that you have to take to reach your destination. As you can imagine, our journey continued from the
            underground. A quick stop at Monmouth for a coffee and off to the British Museum. The exterior and main hall
            of the museum is astonishing, holding a rich collection from different continents and eras. However, I was a
            bit disappointed by the display of the artefacts. In my opinion, it looked a bit poor and not well
            maintained. Something that doesn’t match the greatness and beauty of the artefacts.

            Not so far from the British museum begins Oxford Street. It is Europe’s busiest shopping street, as it
            accommodates many shops from big and luxurious brands. We walked the street from end to end until we reached
            the Marble Arch.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            Of course, we couldn’t leave out Piccadilly Circus. Another busy spot of the city, famous meeting point and
            attraction. It is known for the digital billboards mounted on the facade of the building opposite to
            Shaftesbury memorial fountain. It gives the feeling of a smaller Time Square if you like. Our next and last
            stop for the day was Camden town. Camden is well-known for its open-air markets, both shopping and food,
            music venues and street art. We grabbed some food in the West Yard and had a few drinks in pubs close to
            Regent’s canal. It is a much lively area with many pubs and venues where people can have a fun Saturday
            night. On our way back, we got lost and took a wrong line for a few stops though eventually reached South
            Kensingot station from where we walked while enjoying the summer breeze night. That concluded our first full
            day in the city.

            <p class="caption">Piccadilly Circus</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Next day, we started our excursion by walking around Chelsea. Not far from there, are situated the Natural
            History and Victoria & Albert museums. Both of them are huge with numerous exhibitions, shows, workshops
            etc. that require time. However, our visits were short due to the time limitation on our last day. Our next
            destination was Hyde Park. It is the largest of the Royal Parks in the centre of London. On fine weather
            days, it attracts many tourists and locals that want to escape from the city noise. Throughout the year,
            various events take place and activities that one can do in the park. That evening we had some last strolls
            around the centre as I had to catch a train from Victoria to get back to Haywards Heath. These 42 hours, in
            one of Europe’s finest cities, were amazing and I was glad to have spent them with my sister. This trip left
            me with extraordinary feelings.

            Next week passed quickly, like any other working one. The upcoming weekend, as it would be my last before my
            return, I planned a day trip to Brighton. Brighton is a seaside resort and a popular destination for both
            tourists and locals. It is a lively city with many artistic and musical events and festivals taking place
            throughout the whole year. Early Saturday morning, I took the bus to Brighton. It is approximately an hour
            drive. But time flies when you look outside the window and observe the passing surroundings. The weather was
            warm and sunny that day, luckily without any rain. I jumped off the bus near the city centre and started my
            exploration from the Royal Pavilion and its gardens. Royal Pavilion, was built for George IV as his seaside
            retreat and it was built in the Indo-Saracenic style.
        </p>

            <p class="caption">Royal pavilion</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            After a walk there and getting familiar with the neighbouring area, I walked towards the seaside. From the
            beach, one can see the Palace Pier and the remnants of the West Pier. The latter was built in 1866 and was
            listed as a Grade I pier. Unfortunately, it was burned in 2003 by two consecutive fires.
        </p>
        <div class="polaroid">

            <p class="caption">Brighton beach</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Walking alongside the sea, I reached the Palace Pier. This one still operates nowadays and accommodates an
            amusement park, various arcade games and food stands. If you happen to be in Brighton, it is definitely
            worth paying a visit. Around noon I had a pit-stop in one of the bars situated near the beach, where locals
            and visitors were enjoying some afternoon sun and live band music with a drink and some food. During that
            period there was a festival going on in the city. So all the streets in the centre were busy and the stores,
            restaurants and bars crowded. I moved towards the centre and had a walk around to get a bit of the festive
            feeling myself.
        </p>

            <p class="caption">Brighton pier</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Before catching the bus back, I had a last drink in The Mash Tun, a very lively and joyful pub with diverse
            patrons and many individuals hobnobbing with each other. I should have stayed for the night to experience
            Brighton’s nightlife, but either way, it was a full day. Covered quite a few miles on foot, saw many new
            interesting places and enjoyed a relaxing Saturday. Next week would be my last. Even though I was yearning
            for my return home, that’s when it hit me that I would like to stay a bit longer.
